# Conan-the-Caveman-Linux
=========================

Example project from ['SDL Game Development'][2] by Shaun Mitchell. The book explains everything from a Windows user perspective. Here are instructions to get everything working under Ubuntu:

### Download & compile the latest version SDL2 
Including image, ttf, and mixer extensions.  Please see my [gist explaining how to build said extensions][1]. 

### Install support libraries for Conan the Caveman
    sudo apt-get install libtinyxml-dev
    sudo apt-get install tiled  #for the .tmx files, Tiled Map Editor
